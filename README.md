# Project information
The goal of this application is to generate and manage tournaments for BRESS.
A list of names is provided for a certain category and the app should show the next games prioritized if needed.
Firstly it creates poules. The winners from these poules go to the finals. 
Depending on the size this could be quarter-finals, half-finals or the finale.
The scores are saved and can be viewed in the app.
